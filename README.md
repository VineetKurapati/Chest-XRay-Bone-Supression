# BoneSuppression v2

BoneSuppression v2 is a project focused on the development of a deep learning-based system for bone suppression in medical images. The system utilizes an AE-like model with pooling as a size-changing factor for image reconstruction. Additionally, the project includes data preprocessing utilities for image registration, augmentation, and normalization.

## Introduction
Medical imaging often faces challenges due to the presence of bones, which can obscure important anatomical details. Bone suppression techniques aim to remove or reduce the appearance of bones in medical images, improving the visibility of soft tissues and enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

BoneSuppression v2 offers a deep learning solution for bone suppression, employing an AE-like model trained on medical image datasets. The system preprocesses input data, trains the model, and provides functionalities for testing on new images.

## Features
- Image preprocessing utilities (e.g., registration, augmentation, normalization)
- AE-like model architecture for bone suppression
- Training and testing functionalities
- Configuration via config files for easy customization

## Requirements
- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- SciPy
- scikit-learn
- imreg_dft
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/BoneSuppression_v2.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Organize input and target images in separate folders.
   - Ensure images are in a compatible format (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
2. Configure your training settings in `config/train.cfg`.
3. Train the model:
   ```
   python train.py --config config/train.cfg
   ```
4. Test the model:
   ```
   python test.py --config config/test.cfg
   ```

## Configuration
- `config/train.cfg`: Configuration file for training settings (e.g., image size, learning rate, batch size).
- `config/test.cfg`: Configuration file for testing settings (e.g., model path, input image path, output image path).

## Training
- Adjust training settings in `config/train.cfg` according to your requirements.
- Run `train.py` to start training the model.

## Testing
- Configure testing settings in `config/test.cfg`.
- Run `test.py` to test the trained model on new images.
